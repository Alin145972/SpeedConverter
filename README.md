# SpeedConverter
JAVA miniproject n.1 (simple speed conversion app)

This is a simple program that converts kilometers per hour values in miles per hour values.
When you enter a numeric value and click on "Convert" button, it outputs the corresponding value in mi/h.
If the number is negative it asks you to enter positive values.
If you don't enter anything or if you enter a non-numeric value it asks you to enter valid values.
There is also a reset button;

You can test the app by running the SpeedConvTestApp.jar file. Or by opening it in Eclipse and running SpeedConverter/src/speedConverter/Frame1.java.

If  SpeedConvTestApp.jar doesn't run try installing jdk-17

This is the first program where i tried to build a GUI (with window builder for eclipse).
